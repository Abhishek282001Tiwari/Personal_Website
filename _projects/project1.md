# High-Frequency Trading Engine

A comprehensive high-frequency trading system designed for cryptocurrency and equity markets, featuring modular architecture and LLM-driven alpha signal generation.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **High-Performance Core**
- **Sub-microsecond latency**: Custom C++ order execution engine
- **Real-time data processing**: Multi-threaded market data handlers
- **Memory-mapped I/O**: Optimized for maximum throughput

### ðŸ§  **LLM-Driven Alpha Discovery**
- **News sentiment analysis**: Real-time processing of financial news
- **Pattern recognition**: LLMs identify market regime changes
- **Signal generation**: Automated alpha factor creation and validation

### âš¡ **Modular Architecture**
- **Strategy framework**: Plug-and-play trading strategies
- **Risk management**: Real-time position and exposure monitoring
- **Backtesting engine**: Historical simulation with realistic market impact

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Example strategy integration
class MomentumStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.alpha_model = LLMAlphaGenerator(config)
        self.risk_manager = RealTimeRiskManager()
    
    def on_market_data(self, data):
        signals = self.alpha_model.generate_signals(data)
        orders = self.risk_manager.filter_orders(signals)
        self.execute_orders(orders)
```

### Architecture Overview
1. **Data Layer**: Real-time feeds from exchanges and news sources
2. **Signal Layer**: LLM processing and traditional quantitative models  
3. **Execution Layer**: Order management and latency optimization
4. **Risk Layer**: Real-time monitoring and position management

## Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: 50Î¼s average order-to-market time
- **Throughput**: 100k+ messages/second processing capacity
- **Uptime**: 99.9% system availability
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.3 (backtested on crypto markets)

## Innovation Highlights

**LLM Integration**: First-of-its-kind integration of large language models for:
- Market regime detection from news sentiment
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on market conditions
- Automated strategy generation and optimization

**Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns allows for:
- Easy strategy development and testing
- Independent scaling of system components
- Rapid deployment of new alpha factors

This project demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge AI in financial markets while maintaining the performance requirements of high-frequency trading.
