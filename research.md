<h2>The Challenge with Current AI</h2>

<p>Today's AI systems face a fundamental divide:</p>

<p><strong>Neural Networks</strong> excel at pattern recognition but operate as "black boxes" - they can identify a cat in a photo but cannot explain why it's a cat.</p>

<p><strong>Symbolic AI</strong> excels at logical reasoning and can provide clear explanations, but cannot learn from data or handle uncertainty well.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Neuro-Symbolic Integration</h2>

<p>My research focuses on bridging this gap through Neuro-Symbolic AI - creating systems that combine the learning power of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>Consider a self-driving car approaching an obstacle:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pure neural network might recognize "object ahead" but not understand the implications</li>
<li>A pure symbolic system knows the rules "obstacles should be avoided" but can't identify the obstacle</li>  
<li>A neuro-symbolic system can both <strong>recognize</strong> the obstacle and <strong>reason</strong> about the appropriate response</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Research Directions</h2>

<h3>1. Neural-Symbolic Interfaces</h3>

<p>Developing methods to seamlessly translate between neural representations (patterns, probabilities) and symbolic representations (logic, rules).</p>

<p><strong>Key Question:</strong> How can we create interfaces that allow neural and symbolic components to communicate effectively while maintaining the strengths of both?</p>

<h3>2. Efficient Symbolic Reasoning</h3>

<p>Traditional symbolic reasoning can be computationally expensive. I'm exploring optimizations to make logical reasoning practical for real-time applications.</p>

<p><strong>Key Question:</strong> What approximations and algorithmic improvements can make symbolic reasoning fast enough for real-world deployment?</p>

<h3>3. Applications in Critical Domains</h3>

<p>I'm particularly interested in areas where AI explanations and reliability are essential:</p>

<p><strong>Autonomous Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Robots and self-driving cars that can explain their decisions</li>
<li>Systems that can reason about safety constraints in real-time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High-Stakes Decision Making</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Financial AI that can justify investment recommendations</li>  
<li>Medical systems that can trace diagnostic reasoning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scientific AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Systems that can formulate and test hypotheses</li>
<li>AI that can reason about causal relationships in complex data</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, the ability to understand and trust AI decisions becomes crucial. Neuro-Symbolic AI provides the foundation for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Trustworthy AI</strong> - Systems whose decisions can be verified and validated</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative AI</strong> - Systems that can work alongside humans effectively</li>  
<li><strong>Adaptable AI</strong> - Systems that can apply learned knowledge to new situations</li>
</ul>

<p>My research aims to make this vision practical and scalable, creating AI systems that are not just powerful, but understandable and reliable.</p>
