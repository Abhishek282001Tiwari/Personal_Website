## About Me

I am a quantitative researcher dedicated to advancing the understanding of high-frequency market microstructure and the design of algorithmic trading systems. My work synthesizes stochastic processes, reinforcement learning, and machine learning to develop rigorous, interpretable, and explainable models that capture the nuanced dynamics of financial markets.

At present, I am engaged in constructing modular, real-time trading infrastructures and data-driven frameworks that integrate market microstructure signals with structured and unstructured datasets, bridging theoretical sophistication with practical, deployable solutions.

### Research Interests
- **Market Microstructure & High-Frequency Data: Modeling and analyzing order flow, bid-ask spreads, and intraday price dynamics
- **Stochastic Processes & Quantitative Modeling: Applying continuous-time models, jump-diffusions, and fractional stochastic processes to financial markets
- **Machine Learning for Finance: Developing interpretable and data-driven predictive frameworks for market microstructure, including reinforcement learning and explainable AI approaches.
- **Integration of Textual and Market Signals: Combining financial news, regulatory filings, and alternative datasets with high-frequency market data to improve forecasting and causal understanding.

### Recent Highlights
- Developed a modular high-frequency trading system with real-time alpha discovery using stochastic and ML models.
- Published research on neurosymbolic and interpretable AI frameworks for financial markets.
- Applied data-driven machine learning approaches to real-world financial datasets, exploring predictive modeling and causal inference in market microstructure.
