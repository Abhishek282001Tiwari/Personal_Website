## Research Overview

My research focuses on Neuro-Symbolic AI—bridging the gap between data-driven neural networks and knowledge-driven symbolic reasoning. I develop methods to create AI systems that are both powerful and interpretable.

## Current Research Directions

### Neuro-Symbolic Integration
Developing architectures that combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning, logical constraints, and knowledge graphs.

### Interpretable AI
Creating methods to make complex models transparent and explainable, particularly for high-stakes decision making.

### Knowledge-Enhanced Learning
Integrating structured knowledge with neural learning to improve generalization and reasoning capabilities.

## Research Philosophy

I believe the next generation of AI systems will require a synthesis of neural and symbolic approaches—combining the pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning with the explicit reasoning and transparency of symbolic AI.
